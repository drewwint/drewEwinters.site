bio: My research interests include mental and social health as well as their
  associated neural processes across the lifespan. In this vein, I am interested
  in applying quantitative methods to identify replicable neural mechanisms that
  may improve testing and development of interventions for youth with
  callous-unemotional traits.

Drew E. Winters, PhD, is a Research Faculty member in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, where he directs the **A**ffective **S**ocial **C**ognition, **E**xecutive functioning, and **N**euro-**D**evelopment lab (**ASCEND**).

His research broadly aims to understand neural processes linking [social cognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_cognition) and [executive functioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_functions) to mental health and social behavior across adolescence and into adulthood. These processes can be profoundly impaired—particularly in individuals with [phenotypes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype) associated with [antisocial behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-social_behaviour) (e.g. [callous-unemotionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callous_and_unemotional_traits), [psychopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy)). Drew’s work investigates how social and executive functions interact as a [psychological mechanism](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-3-319-24612-3_1562) as well as the implicated [brain mechanisms (circuits/topology/networks)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41583-023-00778-7) contribute to the development of these traits.

To address these questions, Drew integrates [functional neuroimaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_neuroimaging), [network science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_science), and advanced statistical modeling (e.g., [computational modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_neuroscience), [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning), [growth curve modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_curve_(statistics))). The overarching goal of his work is to identify replicable brain mechanisms that explain the socio-affective and neurocognitive disruptions observed in youth with antisocial tendencies. This research holds promise for improving the development and evaluation of targeted interventions for these populations.
