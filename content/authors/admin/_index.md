bio: My research interests include mental and social health as well as their
  associated neural processes across the lifespan. In this vein, I am interested
  in applying quantitative methods to identify replicable neural mechanisms that
  may improve testing and development of interventions for youth with
  callous-unemotional traits.

Drew holds a Research Faculty appointment at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Psychiatry where he directs the **A**ffective **S**ocial **C**ognition, **E**xecutive functioning, and **N**euro-**D**evelopment lab (**ASCEND**).

Drew’s research broadly aims to understand neural processes underlying the relationship between [social cognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_cognition)  and [executive functioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_functions) concerning mental health and social behavior across adolescence and into adulthood. Profound impairments in these processes can occur and frequently coincide with the development of [phenotypes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype) associated with [antisocial behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-social_behaviour) (e.g. [callous-unemotional traits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callous_and_unemotional_traits), [psychopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy)). In this vein, his research focuses on understanding how the interaction between executive functions and social cognition as a [psychological mechanism](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-3-319-24612-3_1562) as well as the implicated [brain mechanisms (circuits and networks)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41583-023-00778-7) underlying antisocial phenotypes across development. 

In his research, Drew uses [functional neuroimaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_neuroimaging) and [network science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_science) as well as [structural equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_equation_modeling) and [growth curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_curve_(statistics)) models. He leverages these methods to achieve the overall objective of his research – to define [replicable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility) brain mechanisms that underlie neurocognitive and socio-affective impairments associated with youth antisocial phenotypes. This line of work demonstrates promise for improving the way we design and test efficacy of new approaches to help these youth.
